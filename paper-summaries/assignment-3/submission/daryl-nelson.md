## Summary

### What is most interesting in the paper?
I find the comparison between class-based models and word-based models very interesting, particularly the performance differences between the two approaches. Even though the perplexity performance of class-based models is slightly worse, I still believe the benefits of addressing the sparsity problem make this approach a real improvement. From a statistical and algorithmic perspective, it is ingenious: it reduces the number of parameters and increases coverage of unseen words and combinations in a corpus. Despite relying on a greedy algorithm, the method still achieves meaningful results.

### What could the paper have done better?
That said, I think the authors could have explored more algorithms and approaches in the weaker areas of their method. For example, instead of relying only on the greedy clustering algorithm, they might have tried alternative ways of generating word classes. They also did not experiment with different classification methodologies. Since words often have different meanings in different contexts, this issue should have been considered when forming classes.

### What questions do you have from reading the paper?
A few questions I had relate to the clustering approach itself. Are there better ways to form the word classes beyond greedy merging? If words can belong to multiple classes depending on context, how would that affect the quality of the classes created? More broadly, how might these early ideas connect to modern probability estimation techniques and continuous representations, such as embeddings, which allow for more flexible groupings?
